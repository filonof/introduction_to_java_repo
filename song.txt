Think back on what you did
How you'd punk all the new kids
A new wave of exclusive
As if there's something new, kid

We're the patient performer
The kid in the corner
We were just turning you out
We are young and unafraid,
ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
-----------------------------
We are young and unafraid,
ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Allow me to weight in
On this conversation
Here's your invitation
To chew someone else's heel
